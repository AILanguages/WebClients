</li>
<li>P.S. We have also updated our back-end pattern generation for languages in today's release.</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-626j: 13 March 2014: Added perfect tense examples for Portuguese and Spanish. Refactoring ongoing for language generation for better consistency.
    Fixed bug with selection of words that overlap in meaning with other identical words with differing meaning.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-620j: 12 March 2014: Ongoing updates with students to German, Portuguese and Spanish to extend samples. Major revision of generation code
    to simplify generation by language.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-599j: 11 March 2014: Ongoing updates with students to German, Portuguese and Spanish to extend samples.

    only.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-591j: 7 March 2014: Numerous updates around Spanish, Portuguese and German. Refactoring our generation approach to enable all
    lanugages to rely on a single generation model. Along with the content additions for the 3 languages updated with the support of work experience
    students with fluent language skills, we have updated the generation code to include additional agreement requirements.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-580j: 3 March 2014: Numerous updates made including the addition of some Korean examples. For the
    next week we will be correcting our Portuguese, Spanish and German examples with the help of our work
    experience students! Thanks to the workers going through our examples to enable other students
    to see the acurate translations that we require for the school. We expect a YouTube video late this week
    to explain the results.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-575j: 11 February 2014: In Silicon Valley reworking testing regime. A new design for our integration
    tests are now implemented. Added a number of bug fixes and enhancements to the 3 demonstration products.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-558j: 27 January 2014: Refactored to support German and English qustion answering generically.

</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-548j: 20 January 2014: Accumulated updates including the consolidation of language generation into a common area for both generation used in
    translation and generation used in conversation (for all supported languages).
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-540j: 15 January 2014: Added some content for Portuguese and Spanish to allow for "The dog bites the mother" to be generated.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-536j: 14 January 2014: More fixes applied. Major simplification of translation and generation methods to create production-ready code. As a result, we have
    added a number of more shell languages for population when time permits including generation for Japanese. The shell languages are Spanish, Portuguese and
    Italian. At present these languages will not generate translations as their words and phrases are not populated.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-505j: 12 January 2014: Fixes applied. Broke questions into 4 categories, depending whether the question or answer is positive or negative. In English
    it is difficult to answer negative questions, especially to negative information. say: "John did not arrive." question: "Didn't John arrive." Yes? We have implemented
    the answer: "Really, no, he didn't." For future review and discussion.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-503j: 10 January 2014: Fixed answers to align with questions. This ensures that answers align both with the questions and
    the matched information.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0496j: 9 January 2014: Updated answering to deal with additional information. By expanding on yes/no and "I don't know" answers, the
    resposnses appear more natural. Refactored code base to utilise translation genration capability.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0460j: 2 January 2014: Cleaning up continues for 2013 work. Content enhancements to progress in January, with the assistance of
    some local students with foreign language skills. The plan is to provide a number of additional translations to better support school education
    in the short term while scoping the effort required for language-by-language additions.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0443j: 31 December 2013: Happy New Year! Today's updates are mainly internal improvements along with updates to our internal
    testing procecedures to incorporate integration testing. Some significant changes have been made to answering: now generation code is utilised
    to provide responses in the target language. Due to limited language coverage outside of English, this may mean your answers are not good
    if your target langauge isn't English!
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0418j: 25 December 2013: Merry Christmas! Today, we have extended our view of the matched conversational elements to be more generic, and
    include a view of noun clauses, possessives in addition to the clause view with its actor/undergoer elements.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0407j: 23 December 2013: Major upgrade of pronoun resolution / context tracking. A number of consolidations were made to support
    multiple languages and provide a more consistent framework for the future.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0367j: 9 December 2013: Simplified and consolidated (refactorerd) answering code base. Added use of synonyms to hypernyms to
    question-answering capability.

    meaning elements including WSD to the semantic layer. Minor changes to some vocabulary.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0318j: 26 November 2013: Added simple randomisation for responses to add variety to answering.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0314j: 25 November 2013: Ongoing refactoring of question-answering. Pronoun resolution is the current focus.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0312j: 24 November 2013: Major revision complete including question answering bug fixes. Code refactored.
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0291j: 17 November 2013: Implemented improved pronoun resolution. Reflexives working properly within their clause boundary. More
    work required around some pronouns, including first and second person. Improving embedded clause handling within a clause for conversation.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0281j: 13 November 2013: Started treating reflexive pronouns in conversation for better pronoun resolution. Added
    reflexive inhibitions to work in line with RRG observations especially around the order of reflexives in clauses as they relate
    to the logical structures.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0274j: 11 November 2013: Refactored pronoun handling. Added initial check on ambiguity of pronoun use to prompt for clarification.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0269j: 9 November 2013: Published version with simplified pattern matching after refactoring.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0267j: 8 November 2013: Question answering improvements: dealing with some tense and aspect deviations. Has he? No, but he did. And
    negatives to be looked at next. e.g. He didn't do it? No, he did (rather than "Yes, he didn't").
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0264j: 7 November 2013: Question answering improvments added to increase coverage of possibilities. New video to look at changes today.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0255j: 5 November 2013: Question answering demonstrated with yes/no polar questions and what, when and where shown. Continuing work
    on questions and conversation generally to continue.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0244j: 3 November 2013: Additional improvements implemented for demonstration and feedback purposes.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0233j: 31 October 2013: Added server end receipt for text entered in converse screen. The screen is currently online to showcase the
    proposed model. It is not yet operational, and any feedback would be welcomed. To display a sample, type "Sample" and press the ""Say it!"" button.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0229j: 29 October 2013: Added the 'converse' button and screen to interact with the prototype using
    language. Started wiring up an interface to the web service to interact with this client.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0225j: 28 October 2013: Added new functionality for context tracking and incorporation of conversation/discourse. Will reorganise the
    tab selection scheme to combine FAQ/Help and create space for the prototype conversation page.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0215j: 16 October 2013: Person agreement reintroduced for German. Sentences now matching left to right as per English model including
    the ability to start a sentence without just a nominal noun.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0196j: 13 October 2013: Disabled German and Latin person agreement while migrating to new generic patterns for clause matching. This enables the free-word-order
    to be matched without the combinatorial issues. Person agreement to be re-introduced this week.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0189j: 10 October 2013: Minor updated to correct imperatives commands as we validate the existing examples following the RRG migration and the
    addition of translation capability.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0185j: 6 October 2013: A major rework of xml and file loading methods for English has been completed. This rework is not expected to impact on
    the current operation. However it was a pre-requisite to the next phase of development to faciliate expansion of non-English languages. It was also
    necessary for the upcoming integration of the context "proof of concept". Here, the existing engine is supplemented with additional patterns to
    disambiguate between many of the existing context-related limitations. Thanks to all the contributors that achieved this milestone amongst our existing
    workload! (John Ball: 6 Oct 2013)
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0113j: 30 September 2013: Minor data fixes. Working through the examples in sequence to ensure all RRG patterns are now operating correctly.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0112j: 29 September 2013: *** Major *** reorganisation of the xml files into common language structures to make the addition of new languages
    simpler. Working through the examples to simplify their order and make old examples work under the RRG model. This typically involves the identification of
    the language and the addition of the appropriate logical structure to the nucleus.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0084j: 26 September 2013: Redesigned translation elements migrated. Will populate additional examples to demonstrate shortly.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0083j: 24 September 2013: Migration to 'universal encyclopaedia' design completed. Consolidated the parts of speech and extended the use of
    attributes as a part of the redesign. You will notice that the words in a languages are linked to at least one language word to support translation between
    any element of the encyclopaedia and a target language (and vice versa).
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0078j: 23 September 2013: Limited migration to 'universal encyclopaedia' underway. We have removed definitions excepting English ones and linked all
    matches to these. For French, German, Latin and Japanese examples, this means the definitions will be in English for the moment. A side-effect is that all
    words in all languages appear in the sense display, despite them not being available for phrase matching outside of their native language.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0075j: 18 September 2013: Some new usability features have been added. You can now change the target language from the screens that use it, instead of
    just the settings screen. We have also added the key toggle switches to the start screen and the file category selection to the samples page.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0073j: 17 September 2013: Winding up display changes and back-end consolidation. Migrated to more modern c# elements to improve the ability to
    add translation and other additional features to the environment.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0058j: 11 September 2013: Bug fixes applied with code consolidation.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0055j: 9 September 2013: Major rework of the WCF models for the client. This introduces better type management. For those using the web service,
    you need to recompile, referencing the updated models. This completes our work to simplify the code base as our implementation of new functions expands.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0048j: 6 September 2013: Samples tab reworked to select a collection of files. Next examples will be validated following changes in architecture.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0046j: 3 September 2013: Updated display for simple views. In the coming days we will simplify the view to provide the key elements only.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0043j: 31 August 2013: Major refactor of WCF to UI. In other words, simplified user interaction between client and web services to improve
    recovery of lost sessions and simplify transmission of sentence elements.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0027j: 26 August 2013: Bug fix. WCF not behaving well with IIS. Found some StructureMap changes that addressed the change that relates to
    how WCF relates to static variables. Enough said, so here is the release that should stop some sessions not finding matches.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0026j: 25 August 2013: Refactored WCF code to simplify transactions. Improved the web service to stand alone with smaller (more granular)
    transactions to enable more complex client capabilities without changing the server.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0019j: 14 August 2013: Improved translation selection with new main menu tab. This consolidates user settings to the one menu element and
    makes future customisations easier for each web-based user.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0015j: 7 August 2013: Update: add additional translation examples to demonstrate adjective linking to nouns which include word-sense disambiguation.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0008j: 29 July 2013: Update: refactor pattern types for translation purposes to
    facilitate patterns used for matching to be used as generation patterns.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.9-0001j: 22 July 2013: New major release - update to prerelease version 9. Removed alternative pattern capability in order to facilitate
    translation examples and simplify the code base. Patterns now matched with simpler lists, whereas previously limited matching was available
    within a complex pattern. Pattern matching now relies on simple elements and the build up of combinations enables equivalent functionality more easily.
    Focus will now return to demonstration of translation capabilities more broadly.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.8-0172j: 7 July 2013: Added translate samples to discuss display options. Updated non-English examples to include Logical Structures.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.8-0169j: 24 June 2013: Following feedback from schools, some samples have been added for German and Latin. These are just samples,
    like the Japanese examples. Note English has a far larger set of active patterns as needed for the proof of concept.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.8-0166j: 1 February 2013: Draft version of ellipsis introduced with some examples. Need to convert to full version, but ok for
    demonstration purposes. Corrected Japanese example to include different character sets.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.8-0155j: 21 January 2013: Simplified user interface. We are focussing on improving the samples page to finalise the 2012 work.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.8-0144j: 18 January 2013: Adding to samples based on Van Valin juncture and nexus types to expand the range of matched patterns.
    See samples tab '1b.Juncture-Nexus' which will be renamed with the final sample consolidation this month.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.8-0143j: 17 January 2013: Working through samples for better consistency. Not all examples currently working following RRG migration due
    to some patterns not yet migrated.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.8-0140j: 14 January 2013: Fixes applied to deal with reported erros in dealing with nuclear junctures in particular and some over keen
    patterns that evaded intersection.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.8-0134j: 13 January 2013: Major rework of code for intersection, matching and the display of logical structures. This nears the end of
    the RRG conversions for the prototype.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.8-0089j: 2 January 2013: Happy New Year! This release includes a number of old functions not previously migrated to the RRG version such
    as 'tag questions'. They are easy to use, aren't they?
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.8-0081j: 28 December 2012:Migration to structuremap continued to simplify the code base. More examples of RRG and Patom theory to be
    implemented for the year-end activities.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.8-0073j: 26 December 2012: Refactoring completed for now. We have reworked clauses including noun-headed clauses. Logical structure breakdown now
    displayed per licensed core to increase the visibility of the clause buildup from cores. Remember that a logical structure cannot be displayed
    until the end of a sentence is reached because it isn't known until then. Think about it. Note the completeness constraint is not yet implemented which
    allows for some invalid matches. The tradeoff between work effort, duplication and the ability to demonstrate the technology has resulted in the
    pragmatic decision not to implement that requirement at this stage. We need to leave some things for 2013!
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.8-0045j: 17 December 2012: Refactoring continues. Simplifying matching of logical structures for improved display of complex clauses.
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
    Version 0.8-0017j: 14 November 2012: Implemented a few forms of state verbs - feelings, be-ing and raw states. This work locks down the variety
    of matched patterns which will be addressed soon with a catch all, once the standard options are identified. Some infinitive links are also

</li>
<li>
    Version 0.8-0011j: 6 November 2012: Added embedded clauses to deal with infinitive phrases. For example, 'Dana persuaded Kim to eat the

    as an example. The question mark, followed by 'Text=' and your text is the syntax. RRG work has
    slowed to improve the internals of our demo code for more flexibility. The clean
    break between the server and client is finished, with the migration to the new model
    pending completion of RRG migration.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.7-0057j: 22 July 2012: Please use demo.thinkingsolutions.co for the current
    demonstration release. This release is being migrated to RRG and as present it's
    function is limited.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.7-0055j: 21 July 2012: Web service model operating on rrg.thinkingsolutions.co
    on a trial basis to identify the accuracy of the conversion to date to the RRG model.
    We have added a new function to match a pattern from the url as well.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.7-0045j: 9 June 2012: Initiated migration to web service model. Also,
    the pattern model is migrating to the Role and Reference Grammar (RRG) to satisfy
    the requirements for word-sense disambiguation and its consistent, bidirectional
    handling of syntax to semantics regardless of natural language used. Thanks to the
    primary developer of RRG, Robert D. Van Valin, Jr., for his assistance in patiently
    clarifying aspects of RRG to date for us. This version is incomplete, and will form
    the basis of future products.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.7-0024j: 5 March 2012: Added a number of the key contractions used in
    English. At this stage, we have not implemented a word-level pattern matching engine,
    so contractions are handled manually.

    to read.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.7-0006j: 5 February 2012: Created Ajax console to display matches. This
    improves display performance and helps users with clarity around the browser back
    button. Highlighting the selected sample button also for beter clarity.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.7-0001j: 26 January 2012: Major revision completed. The version 7 engine
    is now operating. This brings a large number of changes to the core engine and allows
    for the display of more levels of pattern matching than previous versions. The "Tracking"
    tab in the samples page illustrates the capability of matching phrases embedded
    within others. Happy Australia Day!
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.6-0544j: 31 December 2011: Added additional screen to word display to
    include details of all word forms possible on the second word screen. This allows

    word was (You can look it up if this doesn't make sense!)
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.6-0534j: 21 December 2011: Refactoring. It's that time of year to be ready
    for 2012. We're just improving the design to cater to changes such as the upcoming
    sentence generator and the online school trials. Again, these code improvements
    should result in no visible changes to the program's output.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.6-0526j: 17 December 2011: More changes to code base to improve ongoing
    support. No change to functionality is expected, although some testing indicates
    annother version is required before all samples again function properly.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.6-0525j: 12 December 2011: Refactoring code ongoing to better patterns.
    Japanese example fixed - failing due to typo in clause pattern.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.6-0523j: 7 December 2011: Minor bug fixes. Found some missing load statements
    after migration. Working through examples to repair any failing examples. Reducing
    some duplicates with improved clarity on subjects and objects within clauses.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.6-0522j: 4 December 2011: Large rework to fully separate patterns from
    code base and include settings details within the Xml.
</li>

    the samples before submission.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.6-0484j: 16 October 2011: Simplified internal handling of pattern selection
    for overphrase use including senses and inflections. Minor changes to web user interface
    to clarify which patterns are matched in clauses, nouns and adjective phrases.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.6-0466j: 8 October 2011: Revision of core code to implement improved intersection
    and merge pronoun use with noun use. New examples introduced to demonstrate capability
    of pattern engine.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.6-0455j: 30 September 2011: Eliminated redundant display of patterns that
    are shorter than the longest sentence. Updated CSS to improve sentences display
    and converted some early patterns to more flexible ones around pronouns.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.6-0451j: 28 September 2011: A number of changes are incorporated that
    match more complicated phrases such as adjectives plus clauses and the use of more
    complex phrase patterns (like gerund and infinitive forms) within other patterns.
    Some minor changes added to the user interface to display more matched patterns
    than before.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.6-0406j: 9 September 2011: We have changed the way the web engine works
    to make it easier to maintain. There should be little noticable change this time

    more easily.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.6-0393j: 23 August 2011: major streamlining of phrase-level patterns and
    the loading mechanism. Xml implemented for external pattern loading to enable future
    product flexibility. Many of the trial patterns have been removed and consolidated
    into larger patterns. The net result should be greater reliability although in the
    short-term some missing patterns will result in fewer valid matches.
</li>
<li>
    Version 0.6-0315j: 21 June 2011: include release tracking section. Adding clarification
    of Japanese intent to samples page.
